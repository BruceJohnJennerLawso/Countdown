Countdown-Alert
===============

A pair of programs written in C++ using SFML to act as a dual alarm clock &amp; timer utility.

Currently only available for Windows, hopefully will be available for Linux soon.

For a compiled version of the software, check the Release folder for the latest stable version. Please note that the exes need to be kept in their initial directories that they are in after being unpacked, since both programs use files located in the Alert folder, (textures, sounds, text files, etc...) and will crash if they cannot find them. Otherwise, the folder containing the application set can be moved pretty much anywhere you like on your computer.

Usage is fairly simple; just start the Alert.exe program & type either "alarm" or "timer" to access the respective sub menus. (for a list of available commands in any Cmd-- menu, simply enter "h") Enter "set", & enter the timer run time in seconds (literally the total number of seconds for the program to run. A more conventional hh::mm::ss input format will hopefully be added soon). Hit the GO button to start the timer, & click on the power button to close the alarm window.

Please enjoy. :)
